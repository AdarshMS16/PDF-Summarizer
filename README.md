# PDF-Summarizer
The Generative AI project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a PDF summarizer. This tool generates concise summaries
of content extracted from entire PDF documents. By condensing the information, users can quickly grasp the overview and identify key
topics within the PDF. This summarization feature aids users in efficiently understanding the content and accessing important information
without having to read the entire document.
